# Bookstore Project
Welcome to the Bookstore Project! This is an ongoing project aimed at creating a digital platform for managing a bookstore inventory, facilitating customer transactions, and enabling users to create their own shops to sell both second-hand and first-hand books, notes, and study materials. The frontend is built with Next.js, the backend is powered by Django Rest Framework, and the default Django SQLite database is used.
